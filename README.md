# Inspiration
Women.ly was built to increase awareness about common women's health topics. As a female in computer science, I aim to leverage my computer science skills in the medical industry. One important aspect is informing people about issues before they arise. Women.ly does just this by quizzing users about different health topics.

# What it does
Women.ly is a website that hosts various quizzes on different health disease. Such diseases include heart disease, breast cancer, respiratory disease, cervical cancer, and mental health. Since these topics are too widely discussed, this website makes sure all of them are included. There is also a list of websites about Women's health to encourage further reading.

# How we built it
I built this website in Qoom using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# Challenges we ran into
I have some challenges with the quizzes functions. There was some lagging, deleting on the Qoom end, and the final answers were not displaying properly. However, through some late night debugging and perseverance, I got the website working the way I wanted it to work.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of the professional design of the website. I am also proud of the final quiz functions.

# What we learned
I learned about the various types of diseases that women typically encounter in their lifetime. When researching for quiz questions, I found that there were few websites that had a lot of info on various topics. Since Women.ly is a collective website, I learned that this app is a great starting resource for anyone that wants to learn more about women's health issues.

# What's next for Women.ly
I plan on adding more quizzes about ovarian cancer and anxiety management, as these are topics are encountered often. I would also like an account feature so that the user can save their quiz scores.
